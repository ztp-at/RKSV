new A-SIT tool assumes closed system on AT0, open otherwise, is that ok? if yes, update creation tools
check out new 0.7.1: zero receipts need a valid sig now (why? what about training with all zero?), see if we need to tighten verification
collect multiple errors? right now we fail on the first one
allow creation of variable length turnover counter
try to always get the receipt ID in error messages if possible
improve UI, make long text in text fields wrap, not scroll, add hint texts to tfs...
Write a test suite for the verification functions, see if a-sit tests can help here
Support both counter update methods described in new doc
